# Introduction

Past research has shown that people can reliably track several moving objects among distractors [@pylyshyn1988]. Although laboratory studies typically use clearly visible objects and a uniform background, this is rarely the case for tracking in real life. Therefore, the contribution of visibility and attentional enhancement of visibility to tracking performance is currently underexplored.

**How would be tracking performance impaired when we use more naturalistic setting?**

# Experiment 1

We used Gabor patches as targets and 1/f noise as a background

```{r exp-scheme, fig.align='center',out.width='70%', fig.cap='Typical MOT design (left) and our design (right)'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","scheme_poster.png"))

```


# Methods

* `r df_pilot %>% select(participant) %>% distinct() %>% nrow()` subjects
* 4 conditions  
scaling contrast factor _c_ = 0.1, 0.16, 0.21, 0.25, correspond to foveal d' = 4, 8, 12, and 16
* 1/f noise, Gabor patches as target
* 160 trials (4*40 conditions), 6 seconds of movement
* same trajectories were used for all four conditions
* experiment was programmed in PsychoPy
* participants clicked on the targets, successful click increased the size of the object
```{r mot-scheme, fig.align='center', out.width='65%',fig.cap='Example of typical MOT task'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","scheme_exp.png"))

```

```{r foveal-detection-scheme, fig.align='center', out.width='75%',fig.cap='Detection procedure used to measure sensitivy of gabor detection'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","detection_fovea_scheme.png"))

```


# Results

* Accuracy increased with target detectability
* Number of clicks was large for targets with low detectability

```{r results-ncorr-nclicks, out.width='90%',warning=F,fig.cap='Accuracy for different contrasts (left). Gray line represents individual participants. Number of clicks for different contrasts (right).'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","results_main.png"))

```

# Experiment 2

* Number of clicks was large for targets with low detectability, maybe the decrease in tracking accuracy was result of loss of targets after movement.
* Would object highlighting in query phase increase tracking accuracy?


```{r mot-scheme-exp1, fig.align='center', out.width='70%', fig.cap='MOT with and without highlighted targets'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","exp1","scheme_exp1.png"))

```

# Methods

Same as in experiment 1, with exception:

* `r df_exp1 %>% select(subject_id) %>% distinct() %>% nrow()` subjects
* 4 conditions 
    - 3 noise conditions (scaling contrast factor _c_ = 0.12, 0.14, 0.17, based on Exp. 1)
    - 1 plain background MOT with dots as targets
* Targets highlighted after movement in half of trials
* 256 trials (28 $\times$ 4 conditions $\times$ target highlighting yes/no)
* same trajectories were used for all participants

Study was preregistered: https://osf.io/54p8m

<br/><br/><br/>

# Results

Tested using GLMM with subject and trajectory as random factors

* Accuracy increased with higher detectability  (difference between scaling contrast 0.12 and scaling contrast 0.17: Cohen's *d* = 0.54)
* Difference between target highlighting were significant but small (Cohen's *d* < 0.1)
* Plain background MOT was significantly easier and the accuracy correlated with accuracy in noise conditions (Pearson's *r* = .62 - .66)

```{r results-exp1, fig.align='center', out.width='55%',fig.cap='Results for experiment 1',fig.width=6}

knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","exp1","exp1_results.png"))

```

# Differences between participants

```{r}
cutoff_val <- 220
n_subjects <- df_exp2_range_estim %>% pull(subject_id) %>% unique() %>% length()
n_subjects_invalid <- n_subjects- (df_exp2_good_fits %>% pull(subject_id) %>% unique() %>% length())

desc_stat_params <- rbind(eval_fit %>% 
        filter(min_rule,max_rule, nll < cutoff_val) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarize_at(vars(cT),list(mean = mean, sd = sd, median = median, min = min, max = max, IQR = IQR)),
eval_fit %>% 
  filter(min_rule,max_rule, nll < cutoff_val) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarize_at(vars(beta),list(mean = mean, sd = sd, median = median, min = min, max = max, IQR = IQR)))%>% 
  mutate(var = c("cT","beta")) %>% 
  select(var, everything())

```

Participants significantly differed in tracking accuracy (significant random factor). Maybe the differences were due to the different detection thresholds

* We measured foveal detection to see the variance between subjects
* constant stimuli - wider ranges of values (8 steps, `r range(df_exp2_good_fits$contr_level) %>% paste(collapse = "-")`), fitted by functions from @bradley2014
* 2IFC paradigm (2 $\times$ 250 ms)
* `r n_subjects` subjects, but `r n_subjects_invalid` showed poor fit


```{r results-exp2, fig.align='center', out.width='47%',fig.cap='Accuracy for each contrast level'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","exp2","exp2_range_estim_results_final.png"))

```

Differences between subjects were small:

* $c_T$ = `r desc_stat_params %>% filter(var == "cT") %>% pull(min) %>% round(2)`-`r desc_stat_params %>% filter(var == "cT") %>% pull(max) %>% round(2)`
* $\beta$ = `r desc_stat_params %>% filter(var == "beta") %>% pull(min) %>% round(2)`-`r desc_stat_params %>% filter(var == "beta") %>% pull(max) %>% round(2)`



# Differences between trajectories 

When looking on individual trajectories, can we express, what makes the tracking difficult? We can explore the properties of individual trajectories.

We have repeated presentation of same trajectories for all subjects in Experiment 1 and 2, so we can describe each trajectory by some function and visualize the relationship with tracking accuracy 


```{r traj-var, fig.align='center', out.width='91%',fig.cap='Evaluation of trajectories in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 yielded similar results.'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots","scheme_MOT_traj_var.png"))

```

# Conclusion

* Tracking performance decreases when the target detectability is low
* General tracking performance appears to be partly determined by a combination of detectability both during and after the tracking phase.
* Performance in noise tracking shares individual variability with performance in traditional MOT.
* Trajectories differ in their difficulty. With increasing distance of targets from their center, the tracking becomes more difficult in low detectability condition.
